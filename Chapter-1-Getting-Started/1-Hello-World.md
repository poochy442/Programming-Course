# Chapter 1.1: Hello World

In this chapter, we will guide you through the process of installing Node.js, creating a new project, and writing your first application that prints "Hello World!" to the console.
By the end of this chapter, you will have a basic understanding of setting up your development environment and running a simple Node.js application.

## Installing Node.js

Before we begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machin.
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

To install Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions provided.
4. After the installation completes, open your terminal or command prompt and type `node -v` to verify that Node.js is installed correctl.
   You should see the version number printed in the console.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Node.js on your machine.

## Creating a New Project

Now that you have Node.js installed, let's create a new projec.
A project in Node.js consists of a directory that contains your application's files.

To create a new project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Choose a location on your computer where you want to create your projec.
   Then, run the following commands to create a project directory.

   ```bash
   mkdir hello-world
   cd hello-world
   ```

3. You are now inside your project directory.

## Writing the Hello World Application

Now that we have our project set up, let's write our first application that prints "Hello World!" to the console.

1. Inside your project directory, create a new file called `app.js` using a text editor of your choice.
2. Open `app.js` and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   console.log("Hello World!");
   ```

3. Save the file.

## Running the Application

To run our application, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are in your project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command to execute the `app.js` file:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

3. You should see the following output in the console:

   ```bash
   Hello World!
   ```

Congratulations! You have written and executed your first Node.js applicatio.
The message "Hello World!" was printed to the console.

## Summary

In this chapter, we covered the basics of getting started with Node.js.
You learned how to install Node.js, create a new project, write an application that prints "Hello World!" to the console, and run the application.
This simple example serves as an introduction to writing and executing code using Node.js.
In the next chapter, we will explore variables and functions, building upon what you have learned here.

Take some time to experiment and modify the code.
Try printing different messages or adding more lines of code.
Getting hands-on experience is crucial to your learning journey.

In the [next chapter](./2-Variables-and-Functions.md), we will delve deeper into variables and functions.
Stay excited and keep coding!
